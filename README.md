## Project Description: Terminal Interface Game

This is a browser-based game inspired by Voices of the Void and old operating systems. The player uses a fake terminal to complete different tasks, such as checking servers, fixing systems, and reading log files. The game is made with HTML, JavaScript, and localStorage, so it works without any server.

You play as a new intern working in a strange company. Your job is to connect to servers, repair broken modules, and check equipment remotely. Each server has different parts (like memory, network, storage), and they can stop working at any time. You must use commands like *connect*, *status*, *diag*, and *repair* to solve the problems.

The goal is to create a feeling of isolation, mystery, and hacking. There is no GUI â€” only the terminal and text. Later in the game, the player starts to find strange messages, broken systems, and secrets hidden in the logs.
